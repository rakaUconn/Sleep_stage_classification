    "The method of determining a person's sleep stage by studying their EEG and other physiological signs is known as sleep staging. Sleep recordings are generally separated into 30-second windows, with each window assigned to one of five groups (\"stages\"): <br>\n",
    "1) W: wakefulness\n",
    "2) N1: light sleep\n",
    "3) N2: deeper sleep\n",
    "4) N3: deep sleep\n",
    "5) R: rapid eye movement\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Sleep staging often relies on collecting changes in the EEG's spectral features as well as transitory events (such as sleep spindles, k-complexes, slow waves, and so on) that occur throughout various sleep phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll train a Deep neural network to conduct sleep staging on unseen raw EEG in this work. The Sleep Physionet dataset will be used, which comprises 153 nightly sleep recordings from 78 people. These recordings were carefully staged by sleep specialists, giving us the categorization objectives we needed to train and assess our ConvNet on"
